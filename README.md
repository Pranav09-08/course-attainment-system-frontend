# 🎓 Course Attainment System

## 📘 About the Project

The Course Attainment System is a full-fledged web application designed to assist academic institutions in automating the computation, evaluation, and reporting of Course Outcomes (COs) . This system supports the principles of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) by providing a structured and reliable method for tracking and improving academic attainment levels.

The primary objective of this system is to simplify the complex process of mapping course outcomes, calculating attainment levels, and enabling data-driven academic decisions. It offers a seamless interface for both administrators and faculty members to interact with course-related data and generate actionable reports.

## 📝 Project Description

The Course Attainment System offers an integrated environment for academic administrators and faculty to collaboratively manage and compute CO attainments across multiple subjects and semesters.

Key components include:

✅ A centralized platform for academic departments to automate attainment-related tasks.  
✅ Role-based modules tailored specifically for faculty members and administrators.  
✅ Calculation engines to automatically process and generate attainment levels based on assessment data such as unit tests, internals, and end semester marks.  
✅ Support for articulation matrices to map Course Outcomes (COs) for accurate and meaningful attainment calculations.
